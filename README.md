# Custom Printf Function

![Printf Function](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/228/printf.png)

This project aims to implement a custom version of the `printf` function in C. The function will produce output according to a given format string, similar to the standard library `printf` function.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No global variables are allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file called main.h
- Push your header file
- All header files should be include guarded
- Do not use global variables
- No main functions should be in the header files
- Your code should use the exact same functions as the standard library printf function
- The standard library functions will not be used for anything

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/osunx/printf

2. Compile the files using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o my_printf

3. Execute the program:


## Tasks

1. **I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life**
- Write a function that produces output according to a format. Handle conversion specifiers: `c`, `s`, and `%`.

2. **Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't**
- Handle conversion specifiers: `d`, `i`.

3. **With a face like mine, I do better in print** (Advanced)
- Handle the custom conversion specifier: `b` (binary).

4. **Nothing in fine print is ever good news** (Advanced)
- Optimize by using a local buffer of 1024 chars to call write as little as possible.

5. **My weakness is wearing too much leopard print** (Advanced)
- Handle the custom conversion specifier: `S` (string).

6. **How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print** (Advanced)
- Handle the conversion specifier: `p`.

7. **The big print gives and the small print takes away** (Advanced)
- Handle the flag characters `+`, `space`, `#` for non-custom conversion specifiers.

8. **Sarcasm is lost in print** (Advanced)
- Handle the length modifiers `l` and `h` for non-custom conversion specifiers.

9. **Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests** (Advanced)
- Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

10. **The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance** (Advanced)
 - Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

11. **It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print** (Advanced)
 - Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

12. **Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print whatever, suddenly I would see a collection** (Advanced)
 - Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

13. **Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party** (Advanced)
 - Handle the custom conversion specifier: `r` (reversed string).

14. **The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring** (Advanced)
 - Handle the custom conversion specifier: `R` (ROT13'ed string).

15. **All the above options work well together** (Advanced)
